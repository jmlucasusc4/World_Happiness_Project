# World_Happiness_Project

This dataset was featured on Kaggle. 

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

Exploratory Data Analysis
In thos proceess, the variable that has then strongest correlation with the other variables is identified. The GDP has a strong correlation with the Overall Rank, Genersoity, and other variables measured in this dataset.

Linear Regression
Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a statistical method used for predictive analysis.

It shows a relationship between dependent (Y) and independent variables (X). It finds the value of "Y" changes according to the independent variables.

Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction
PCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. The reduction of the dimensions of the data, yet preserve the variance for analysis. This is important in providing non-parametric analysis.

Variance
In this model we can use Linear Regression and PCA to recognize variance. The more variability in a particular direction correlates with explaining the behavior of the dependent variable.
